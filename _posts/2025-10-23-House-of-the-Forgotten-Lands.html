        <h2>Challenge Description</h2>
        <blockquote>
          <p>In the quiet stretches of forgotten lands, some places linger, unnoticed
            and untouched, as though time itself has chosen to bypass them. A humble
            dwelling, nestled in a corner of the world that few travelers ever venture
            to. At first glance, it appears to be nothing more than an ordinary house,
            weathered by time, blending into its surroundings as if it were part of
            the very earth itself.</p>
          <p>But as you begin to search, something feels… off. The house, though unremarkable
            on the surface, seems to hold secrets hidden beneath its foundation. A
            faint sense of magic lingers in the air, barely perceptible, but undeniable.
            Why has this house remained so inconspicuous in a world full of grand castles,
            mythical creatures, and ancient ruins? What is its purpose, and who—or
            what—might have called it home?</p>
          <p>The more you uncover, the deeper the mystery grows. The trail is faint,
            the records scarce, but you cannot shake the feeling that this house holds
            a story—a story buried deep within its walls, waiting to be revealed.</p>
          <p>And as you continue your search, following the scattered clues, you might
            find yourself thinking: "After all this, I could really use a good soak
            in a nearby hot tub." Whether it’s the slow pace of discovery or the mystery
            itself, sometimes the greatest rewards are found in the simplest of comforts.</p>
          <p>Good luck uncovering the mysteries of the House of the Forgotten Lands.</p>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>Most of the description is just fun little background for a challenge
          that doesn't really provide anything useful to the challenge however there
          is one line specifically that should be considered a hint (more on this
          later).</p>
        <h3>Where is the Sun?</h3>
        <p>Some things that need to be taken into consideration is the direction
          of the house is facing. Though it is difficult to tell we are able to faintly
          see the shadows of the trees. This tells us that the sun is behind the
          camera somewhere on the right side. While the image is well lit, it doesn't
          seem to be the brightest it could be if it were mid day, so we can assume
          its before mid day. If we take both of these into consideration we can
          reasonably argue that the house is facing South as the sun is yet to reach
          it's highest point and its path from our perspective is right to left or
          in other words East to West.</p>
        <aside class="admonition note">
          <p>Knowing the house is facing South with the sun rising from the East from
            behind our perspective, we can narrow it down to the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
        </aside>
        <h3>What brand is that caravan?</h3>
        <p>Next we can take notice of the caravan next to the house. If we give the
          image to Google Images and focus on the caravan we get quite a few results
          leading back to the brand, Knaus.</p>
        <aside class="admonition note">
          <p>Knaus being a German brand allows to shift our prospective closer to Europe.</p>
        </aside>

        </figure>
        <h3>The Hill</h3>
        <p>Nothing really to point out about the hill besides the fact that you know
          the hill is on the right and will help you line up the house. I guess you
          could have used a topographic map looking for villages that have a hill
          on the East side.</p>
        <aside class="admonition note">
          <p>Honestly I choose this specific location for 2 reasons. I randomly spun
            google maps a ton and zoomed in on a single location and I really liked
            the hill. Gave me Windows XP Bliss vibes.</p>
        </aside>
        <h3>The Hot Tub</h3>
        <figure class="image image-style-align-right">
          <img style="aspect-ratio:235/145;" src="https://github.com/GregorSec/GregorSec.github.io/blob/main/_posts/GEOSINT%20Challenge%20House%20of%20the%20Forgotten%20Lands/GEOSINT Challenge House of.JPG" alt="Guesthouse near the house." width="235" height="145">
        </figure>
        <blockquote>
          <p>After all this, I could really use a good soak in a nearby hot tub.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This line alluded to a nearby guesthouse that mentions free hot tub. This
          in my opinion is the biggest give away before the extra hints. However
          this alone does not provide us much detail on the actual location of the
          house.</p>
        <aside class="admonition important">
          <p>There is a hot tub nearby!</p>
        </aside>
        <h3>The House</h3>
        <aside class="admonition important">
          <p>We can clearly see that the house has a number on it, 5.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>Congrats that's ⅓ of the flag!</p>
        <p>Seriously though, we know the house is visible via street view. The style
          is not typical for a Western Style house. This further points it closer
          to the East.</p>
        <h3>Hint #1 (or 2 if you consider the hot tub line a hint)</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The house is rumored to be in lands covered in ice. With a measly population
            that numbers less than 200.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This hint basically just tells you it's Iceland as well as it's a very
          small town.</p>
        <p>Using this information you could have used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localities_of_Iceland">Locations of Iceland wiki page</a> to
          form a list of villages and settlements to narrow your search.</p>
        <h3>Hint #2 (or 3)</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The street name sounds/looks like it could be a name for a dragon.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>I will admit this one is pretty subjective, however I personally find
          that the street name, Smaragrund, to sound as if it were taken straight
          from a fictional story. It appears to be a combination of the Icelandic
          words, <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/smaragd">smaragd</a> meaning
          emerald and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/grund">grund</a> meaning
          ground. Essentially meaning Emerald Ground.</p>
        <p>This makes me think of Smaug from J.R.R Tolkien's The Hobbit. Thus I imagine
          a Emerald Green dragon with the power to shake the ground, named Smaragrund.</p>
        <aside
        class="admonition note">
          <p>I guess my hint should have included the either of these words: Emerald
            or Green. So I apologize as this hint was not very good.</p>
          </aside>
          <h4>Flagging</h4>
          <p>Using a combination of information gathered from the Analysis (and the
            hints if these were used), you would have eventually gotten to Laugarbakki,
            Iceland. Using the satellite view, you would eventually find our House
            of the Forgotten Lands!</p>
