We have found an image of the 4 cargo ships meeting up with 2 ships to transfer the weapon over. However our inside source was silenced before they could tell us where it was taken. We need you to figure out where the handoff took place so we can dig up some dirt from the locals.</span>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <p>Upon the initial analysis of the image, we can see what appears to be
          a setting sun, 4 cargo ships sailing from left to right, 2 sailboats sailing
          from right to left, some rocks in the water, and grass.</p>
        <h3>Where is the Sun?</h3>
        <p>With what appears to be the sun setting we can reasonably assume that
          the left side of the image is actually West. This allows us to determine
          that our perspective is facing North.</p>
        <aside class="admonition important">
          <p>Knowing the sun is setting allows us to determine that we are facing North.
            This would mean that this image was most likely taken in the Southern Hemisphere</p>
        </aside>
        <h3>What about the ships?</h3>
        <p>We can take notice that the ships are close enough to look decently sized
          in the photo but still far away enough that it does not appear they are
          preparing to dock here. This likely means they are sailing past which should
          lead us to thinking we are on an island.</p>
        <aside class="admonition important">
          <p>If we are indeed on an island, in the Southern Hemisphere, this is extremely
            helpful for narrowing down potential locations, I would say about 20 locations
            or so.</p>
        </aside>
        <h3>The rocks</h3>
        <p>We can clearly see that there are black volcanic rocks in the water just
          off the coastline. This further strengthens our lead of it being an island
          specifically one of volcanic origin.</p>
        <aside class="admonition important">
          <p>We are almost 100% sure we are on an island in the Southern Hemisphere
            of volcanic origin.</p>
        </aside>
        <h3>Hint #1</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Investigate southern remote islands along quiet trade routes known for
            cargo handoffs away from surveillance.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This just straight up tells us we are in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
        <p>Using this information you could have used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere#Island_countries_or_territories">Island countries or territories section in the Southern Hemisphere</a> wiki
          to form a list of potential islands to narrow our search.</p>
        <h3>Hint #2</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>The first time our contact was willing to meet us, required us to meet
            at the only town in the area.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This would narrow it down to islands that have only 1 main town/city.</p>
        <aside
        class="admonition note">
          <p>The flag format also alludes to this by using the word seat instead of
            town.</p>
          </aside>
          <h4>Flagging</h4>
          <p>Using a combination of information gathered from the Analysis (and the
            hints if these were used), you would have found Hanga Roa, Easter Island.
            Simply using street view along the coastline we can find the exact spot
            to confirm that this is the correct location.</p>
          <aside class="admonition tip">
            <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanga_Roa">Hanga Roa wiki</a> provides
              you with all the information required for the flag. Seat in this case would
              be the administrative center or capital of that island.</p>
